# auto-midi-map

Automatically structure the children of Wwise container and set the MIDI properties based on a naming convention.

## Overview

It is possible to implement a sample-based MIDI instrument in Wwise directly in the Actor-Mixer hierarchy. 
However, it can be a tedious task. This tool aims to ease the setup of such complex structures by setting up
automatically the structure for you after you imported the sounds.
